## III. Software Setup
> The DeepPicar repository is built and tested on the Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy) Bullseye. You can flash your Raspberry Pi Zero using the official Raspberry Pi Imager, available [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
>
> ### Install DeepPicar Repo
>
> Clone the DeepPicar repository and install dependencies:
>
> ```bash
> git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/CSL-KU/DeepPicar-v3
> cd DeepPicar-v3 
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
> sudo apt install libopenblas0
> sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
> sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
> ```
>
> ---
>
> ### Configure Drivers
>
> Edit the `params.py` file to select the correct **camera** and **actuator** drivers.  
> If you are using parts from the build list, you can skip this.
>
> ```python
> camera = "camera-webcam"
> actuator = "actuator-drv8835"
> ```
>
> ---
>
> ### Setup Driver for Pololu DRV8835
>
> To install the Python driver for the Pololu DRV8835 motor controller:
>
> ```bash
> cd drv8835-motor-driver-rpi
> sudo python3 setup.py install
> ```
>
> ---
>
> ### Setup Gamepad Support (Logitech F710)
>
> If you'd like to use a gamepad for data collection, set up the `inputs` Python package:
>
> ```bash
> cd inputs
> sudo pip3 install .
> ```


## IV. Test
> ### Login to your Pi
> SSH into your Pi over local WIFI  
>
> Before you start driving your car, make sure to enable legacy camera support.  
> ```
> $ sudo raspi-config
> ```
> Navigate to interface options, select legacy camera, and click on yes.
> 
> ### Start the control script
> 
> ```
> $ cd DeepPicar-v3
> $ sudo nice --20 python3 deeppicar.py -n 4 -f 30
> ```
> 
> Keyboard controls:  
> **A**: move forward   
> **Z**: move backward  
> **S**: stop  
> **J**: turn left  
> **K**: center  
> **L**: turn right   
> **R**: start/stop recording  
> **D**: turn on DNN  
> 
> Use the keys to manually control the car. Once you become confident in controlling the car, collect the data to be used for training the DNN model. 
> 
> The data collection can be enabled and stopped by pressing `R`. Once recording is enabled, the video feed and the corresponding control inputs are stored in `out-video.avi` and `out-key.csv` files, respectively. Later, we will use these files for training. It can be downloaded using scp commands.
> 
> Each recording attempt will overwrite the previous.
> 
> Compress all the recorded files into a single zip file, say Dataset.zip for Colab.
> 
> ```
> $ zip Dataset.zip out-*
> ```
> 
> ## Train the model
>     
> Open the colab notebook. Following the notebook, you will upload the dataset to the colab, train the model, and download the model back to your PC. 
> 
> [Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sC2sLeO5HAbc5oXotxMGp0SUncoDP4AF?usp=sharing)
> 
> After you are done training, you need to copy the trained tflite model file (`large-200x66x3.tflite` by default) to the Pi using scp commands.
> 
> ## Autonomous control
> 
> Copy the trained model to the DeepPicar. 
> 
> Enable autonomous driving by pressing A to go forward then D to start the DNN.
>

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### 1. Raspberry Pi Won't Boot
- **Check power supply:** Ensure your power adapter provides enough current (at least 2.5A for most models).
- **SD card issues:** Re-flash the SD card with a fresh image. Make sure the card is properly inserted.
- **Loose connections:** Double-check all cables and connectors.

### 2. Motors Not Responding
- **Wiring:** Verify all motor wires are connected to the correct pins on the motor driver and Raspberry Pi.
- **Power:** Ensure the battery or power source for the motors is charged and connected.
- **Code:** Test with a simple motor control script to isolate hardware vs. software issues.

### 3. Camera Not Detected
- **Connection:** Make sure the camera ribbon cable is fully inserted and oriented correctly.
- **Enable camera:** Run `sudo raspi-config` and enable the camera interface.
- **Test:** Use `raspistill -o test.jpg` to check if the camera works.

### 4. Wi-Fi/Network Issues
- **Credentials:** Double-check your Wi-Fi SSID and password in the configuration.
- **Signal:** Move closer to the router or use a Wi-Fi dongle with better reception.
- **IP Address:** Use `ifconfig` or `hostname -I` to find the Pi’s IP address.

### 5. Software Installation Errors
- **Dependencies:** Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` before installing packages.
- **Python packages:** Use `pip3 install --user <package>` to avoid permission issues.
- **Permissions:** Use `sudo` only when necessary.

### 6. Car Not Driving Straight
- **Calibration:** Adjust motor calibration values in your control script.
- **Mechanical:** Check for obstructions or misaligned wheels.

### 7. Unexpected Shutdowns or Freezes
- **Overheating:** Ensure the Pi has proper ventilation or a heatsink.
- **Power:** Use a reliable power supply and check for voltage drops.

### 8. No Video Stream
- **Firewall:** Ensure no firewall is blocking the streaming port.
- **Browser:** Try a different browser or clear cache.
- **Service:** Restart the streaming service or check logs for errors.
